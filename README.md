# Train Time

My first app with a database! This app allows users to input new trains to the schedule by adding info about their names, destinations, first arrivals, and frequencies. It then shows all the trains that are currently on the schedule and refreshes the "Minutes Away" column each minute so you can see how far out each train is. The database used is Google's Firebase.

The site is live [here](https://victoriaashling.github.io/trainTime).
